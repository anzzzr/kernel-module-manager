# Kernel Module Management System (Backend)

## Overview

The **Kernel Module Management System** is a Go-based application that provides an API for managing Linux kernel modules. This system allows users to load and unload kernel modules programmatically through HTTP requests, facilitating easier management without needing direct command-line interaction.

## Features

- Load and unload kernel modules via RESTful API.
- Error handling and status messages for each operation.
- Simple structure for easy expansion and modification.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Language:** Go
- **Routing:** Gorilla Mux
- **HTTP Server:** Go's built-in `net/http`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (1.16 or later) installed on your system.
- A Linux environment (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) for loading and unloading kernel modules.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kernel-module-manager.git
   cd kernel-module-manager go mod tidy

2. **Build the Application**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   sudo go run main.go

4. **API Endpoints**

- Load a Module
- Endpoint: POST /module/load/{module}
- Description: Loads the specified kernel module.
- Example:
   ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/module/load/loop

- Unload a Module
- Endpoint: POST /module/unload/{module}
- Description: Loads the specified kernel module.
- Example:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/module/unload/loop
## Error Handling
The application will respond with error messages in case of failure to load or unload a module. Common issues may include:
- Invalid module name.
- Module currently in use.
- Insufficient permissions (make sure to run the server with sudo).

## Feature Iteration
### Authentication and Authorization
Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT or OAuth) to secure access to the API, ensuring that only authorized users can load or unload kernel modules.

### Web Dashboard
Even if youâ€™re not implementing a frontend now, consider building a web dashboard in the future that visually represents loaded modules, their statuses, and potential issues.

### Logging and Monitoring
Integrate a logging system to keep track of all operations (loading/unloading) and errors. This can help in troubleshooting and understanding the usage patterns.

### Health Monitoring
Include a health check endpoint to monitor the status of kernel modules, showing which ones are currently loaded and any potential conflicts or issues.

### Module Dependencies
Create a mechanism to handle dependencies between modules, allowing users to load a module automatically when its dependencies are loaded.

### Batch Operations
Allow loading or unloading multiple modules in a single API call to improve efficiency, especially in environments with numerous kernel modules.

### Detailed Error Reporting
Enhance error responses with more detailed information about why a module failed to load or unload, which can assist users in diagnosing issues.

### Configuration Files
Introduce the ability to load module configurations from a file, allowing users to specify settings for modules without manual input.

### CLI Interface
Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for the management system that interacts with the backend API, providing a more traditional tool for advanced users.

### User Notifications
Implement a notification system (via webhooks or email) that alerts users when certain events occur, such as a module failing to load.

### Custom Module Management
Provide functionality for users to upload and manage custom kernel modules through the API, including versioning support.

### Support for Kernel Module Parameters
Allow users to specify parameters for modules when loading them, providing more control over module behavior.

### Performance Metrics
Track and display metrics related to module usage and performance, helping users optimize their kernel configurations.

### Documentation Generation
Automatically generate API documentation based on your routes and handlers, making it easier for users to understand how to use the API.

### Integration with Container Orchestration
If you plan to deploy this system in a containerized environment, consider integrating it with orchestration tools like Kubernetes, allowing for dynamic module management based on container states.
